# Determining a Valid NavStatus

The first part of this experiment experiment can be done doing a confusion 
matrix of the K-Means dataset with the navstatus and cluster variables.

The second part can be seen with our visualization tool at
http://patrons.bsc.es/ selecting dataset "CRBMResults", ship 206 and varible
"cluster". All the ships and variables can be explored with it.
